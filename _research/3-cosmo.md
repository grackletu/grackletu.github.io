## Statistical cosmochemistry & astronomy
Meteorites, fragments of the solar systemâ€™s first generations of planetesimals and relics of our solar systemâ€™s protoplanetary disk, provide the only samples of any stellar system available to study with laboratory methods. 
While extrasolar protoplanetary and debris disks may be observed remotely, meteorites alone afford the opportunity to study diverse disk materials with high analytical precision. 

We use computational methods, including statistical and numerical modeling techniques, to evaluate models of early solar system processes in the context of large cosmochemical datasets.

## Water on asteroids

A recent study ([Turner+ 2021](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abc8116)) reported evidence of recent hydrologic activity in asteroidal permafrosts, and sample return missions (e.g. [Lauretta+ 2024](https://doi-org.trinity.idm.oclc.org/10.1111/maps.14227)) confirm the watery histories of carbonaceous asteroids, such as Bennu (below). I am eager to use techniques honed in terrestrial permafrost and subglacial systems to further explore this emerging field of research.
