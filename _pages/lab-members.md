## Student Researchers

I just started at Trinity in Fall 2024, so no one is working in the lab yet! Are you a student interested in getting involved in current lab projects, or do you have an Earth/planetary/environmental chemistry idea you want to explore? I would love to hear it! Drop me a line at gedward1 [at] trinity.edu or stop by my office (236 [Marrs McLean Hall](https://www.trinity.edu/directory/spaces-places/marrs-mclean-hall#directions)).
