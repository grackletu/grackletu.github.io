I ([Graham Edwards](https://grahamedwards.github.io)) once swore I would never use a whimsical acronym for a lab. I scientifically matured among planetary scientists, where I saw all sorts of goofy (often forced) acronyms, and I vowed to never be so ridiculous. Yet, here we are, so I feel compelled to explain myself.

A lifelong fan of blackbirds (especially,the [red-winged blackbird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-winged_blackbird) and [common grackle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_grackle)), I instantly fell in love with the great-tailed (or Mexican) grackle ([*Quiscalus mexicanus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great-tailed_grackle)) when I first visited San Antonio. Our local grackles are inquisitive, active, charismatic, and mischievous. A native species, the great-tailed grackle is probably the most iconic and familiar San Antonio local.

 Yet, along with many other blackbirds, humans often malign these beautiful and capable creatures are often maligned by humans for their opportunistic behavior. But it's not their faults humans built settlements around them.

And so, I wanted to honor the local grackles of southern Texas when I was developing this lab. And that meant a little (overly) creative acronym-smithing. A younger me might have thought this was for the birds, but I suppose that's exactly the point... üê¶
