I ([Graham Edwards](https://grahamedwards.github.io)) once swore I would never use a whimsical acronym for a lab. I scientifically matured among planetary scientists, where I saw all sorts of goofy (often forced) acronyms, and I vowed to never be so ridiculous. Yet, here we are, so I feel compelled to explain myself.

A lifelong fan of blackbirds (especially,the [red-winged blackbird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-winged_blackbird) and [common grackle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_grackle)), I instantly fell in love with the great-tailed (or Mexican) grackle ([*Quiscalus mexicanus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great-tailed_grackle)) when I first visited San Antonio. Our local grackles are inquisitive, active, charismatic, and mischievous. A native species, the great-tailed grackle is probably the most iconic and familiar San Antonio local.

So, as I developed this lab, I wanted to honor the local grackles of southern Texas, and this required a little (overly) creative acronym-smithing. A younger me might have thought this was for the birds, but I suppose that's exactly the point... 🐦
